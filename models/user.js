// The "models" object is provided by the Mongoose library and stores all the registered models.
// If a model named "User" already exists in the "models" object, it assigns that existing model to the "User" variable.
// This prevents redefining the model and ensures that the existing model is reused.

// If a model named "User" does not exist in the "models" object, the "model" function from Mongoose is called to create a new model
// The newly created model is then assigned to the "User" variable.
  
const User = models.User || model("User", UserSchema);
//check if user is in models because this route gets called everytime
//and the connection is established everytime from scratch so that's why I check.

//in Next.js, the route will only be created and running the time it is called
export default User;
